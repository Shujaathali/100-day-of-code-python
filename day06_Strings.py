# Day 6 of 100 Days of Python
# Topic: Strings in Python

# ðŸ‘‰ String is a sequence of characters.
# We can write strings using:
# 1. Single quotes ('...')
# 2. Double quotes ("...")
# 3. Triple quotes ('''...''' or """...""")

# Example with single and double quotes
a = "My name is"
b = 'Shujaath Ali'
print(a, b)

# Example with triple quotes (multiline string)
info = '''My name is Shujaath Ali
I am learning Python 
for a good career.'''
print(info)

# Extra examples (optional practice):

# Concatenation (joining strings)
print(a + " " + b)

# String length
print("Length of info:", len(info))

# String with escape sequence 
quote = "He said \"Python is awesome!\""
print(quote)
