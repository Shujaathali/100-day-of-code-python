#this is a day 2 of 100 day of python coding 
#today we are learning about comment,escape
#sequence characters 



#Now first one is what is comment and how we can use it

#so comment means you write somthing in code but you wont python can't exicute this lines so you can use # hashtag and write any thing for example alert message, reminder etc whatever you want python can't execute so use # and "' '" triple quotetion like this

print("hello world")# can't remove this line
"'can't remove this line'"
print("hello world")


#And second one is escape sequence characters escape sequence character only use in string if you write outside of string so show's syntex error besauce ecsape sequence inside the  string

# Escape sequences demo in Python

print("1. New Line (\\n):")
print("Hello\nWorld")

print("\n2. Tab (\\t):")
print("Hello\tWorld")

print("\n3. Backslash (\\\\):")
print("C:\\Users\\Shoaib")

print("\n4. Single Quote (\\'):")
print('It\'s OK')

print("\n5. Double Quote (\\\"):")
print("He said \"Hi\"")

print("\n6. Carriage Return (\\r):")
print("Hello\rWorld")

print("\n7. Backspace (\\b):")
print("Helloo\b")

print("\n8. Form Feed (\\f):")
print("Hello\fWorld")

print("\n9. Bell Alert (\\a):")
print("Beep sound if system supports\a")

print("\n10. Vertical Tab (\\v):")
print("Hello\vWorld")

# Raw string demo
print("\n11. Raw String (r'...'):")
print(r"Hello\nWorld")

#if you dont want to execute escape sequence characters so you can use this sequence print(r"write \nstring \fhere")
